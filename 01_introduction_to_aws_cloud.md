# Introduction to the AWS Cloud

## Cloud Computing
* The on-demand delivery of IT resources and applications via the 
    Internet.

### Advantages:
* We can access servers, databases, storage, and higher-level 
  application components in seconds. 
* Resources can be treated as temporary and disposable.
* Change management and capacity planning is more agile and efficient, 
  which reduces risk.
* Security advantages:
  * Can test often, patch quickly, and react to incidents quickly.
  * Can sacle up/down to meet seasonal requirements.
  * You can place servers across the globe, in multiple datacenters.
    * Global reach in just moments.
    * Decrease latency.

## Agility
* Increasing speed.
* Ease of experimentation.
* Cultivating a culture of innovation.

## Elasticity
* The power to scale up as the workload grows and shut down resources
  that are no longer needed.
* The ability to quickly deploy new applications..

## Reliability
* The ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service
  failures.
* The ability to acquire computing resources to meet demand and mitigate   disruptions.
* To achieve reliability, your system must be able to handle changes
  in demand, detect failures and do self-healing.

## Regions
* A separate geographic area that has multiple, isolated locations.

## Availability Zones
* The multiple, isolated locations within AWS regions.
* Allows for resiliency in the face of most failures, natural disasters,
  and system failure.

## Fault Tolerance
* A system's ability to remain operational, even if some of that
  system's components fail.

## High Availability:
* Ensures that your systems are always functioning and accessible, and
  that downtime is minimized as much as possible, without the need for
  human intervention.

## Security
* AWS customers retain complete control over their data.
* This facilitates meeting regional compliance and data-residency
  requirements.
* Data centers are staffed by security 24 x 7.
