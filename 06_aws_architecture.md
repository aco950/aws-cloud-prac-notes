# Fault Tolerance and High Availabilty

## Fault Tolerance:
* The ability for a system to remain operational even if some of the
  components of that system fail.
* Built-in redundancy of an application's components.

## High Availability (ensures that):
* Systems are always functioning and available
* Downtime is minimized
* Minimal human intervention is required
* Minimal up-front financial investment

## High Availability - On Premises vs AWS:
* Traditional (on premises)
  * Very expensive
  * Only mission-critical applications
* AWS
  * Multiple servers
  * Multiple Availability Zones
  * Multiple Regions
  * Access to fault-tolerant services to use as you please
