# Fault Tolerance and High Availabilty

## Fault Tolerance:
* The ability for a system to remain operational even if some of the
  components of that system fail.
* Built-in redundancy of an application's components.

## High Availability (ensures that):
* Systems are always functioning and available
* Downtime is minimized
* Minimal human intervention is required
* Minimal up-front financial investment
