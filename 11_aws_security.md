# Amazon Inspector

## What is Amazon Inspector? 
* An automated security assessment service
* Agent-based, API-driven, and delivered as a service
* Assesses applications for:
  * Vulnerabilities
  * Deviations from best practices
    * Both before they are deployed and when they are running in a 
      production environment.
  * Produces a detailed report with:
    * Security findings
    * Prioritized steps for remediation
      * AWS does not guarantee that following the provided 
        recommendations will resolve every potential security issue 
        (see the AWS Shared Responsibility Model).

## Amazon Inspector helps address the following issues:
* IT security challenges
  * IT security matters, and securing IT infrastructure is:
    * Complex
    * Expensive
    * Time consuming - build/configure/maintain
    * Difficult to track all the changes in an IT environment
    * Hard to do effectively
      * Without an effective, automated tool to perform security
        assessments, companies spend too much time doing manual
        assessments - and run the risk of missing security 
        vulnerabilities.
